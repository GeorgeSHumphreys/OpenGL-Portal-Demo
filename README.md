# Portal Demonstration in OpenGL
After learning the basics of OpenGL through University, I decided to further my learning by learning how to work with shaders and lighting using some better techniques. This was the applied to a new shader using Frame buffers to render a camera image onto a plane. This resulted in a portal shader!

With this application, The portal can be tilted in all directions and the camera will be alligned properly with the portals Transform values. 
To help my knowledge on 3D graphics using OpenGL, https://learnopengl.com/ proved to be an extremely useful tool in understanding different graphical applications.
